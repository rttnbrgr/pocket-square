I’ve been developing websites since Flash popups were a thing. But I promise, I had nothing todo with that! I built interactive websites for products and companies. I switched to HTML and JavaScript once mobile web browsing gained popularity. To me, coding is a lifelong learning exercise that I truly enjoy. I spend most of my time these days making the web more responsive.
